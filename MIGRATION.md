- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration with Next.js rules
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated GitHub Actions workflow for Next.js build

### Preserved Files
All files in the `public/` directory are preserved and included in the build:
- `admin/` - Decap CMS admin interface
- `privacy.html` - Privacy policy
- `terms.html` - Terms of service
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `robots.txt` - SEO crawler instructions
- `sitemap.xml` - Updated sitemap with new pages

## Build Output
The build generates a fully static site in the `out/` directory:
- All pages are pre-rendered as static HTML
- CSS is optimized and purged
- JavaScript is code-split for optimal loading
- Assets are properly organized with Next.js caching

## Design Features
- **Professional nonprofit aesthetic** with blue (#2c5aa0) and purple color scheme
- **Mobile-first responsive** design with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Accessibility** features including skip links and ARIA labels
- **Modern UI** with gradients, shadows, and smooth transitions
- **SEO optimized** with proper meta tags and structured data

## Deployment
The site is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:
- Base path: `/Technologymonastery.org`
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions on push to main
- URL: `https://freeforcharity.github.io/Technologymonastery.org/`

## Verification
âœ… All requirements met:
- package.json includes "next" and "react"
- No index.html in root directory
- app/ directory with .tsx files
- next.config.js has output: 'export'
- GitHub Actions configured for npm build
- All 5 pages render correctly
